### Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

**Project Goal:**
This project aims to provide a deep dive into the theoretical underpinnings of common data structures and algorithms, implemented and explained in JavaScript. It covers a wide range of topics, from fundamental data structures to complex graph algorithms, with a focus on understanding their inner workings and performance characteristics.

**Key Topics:**

### Data Structures

* **Linear Data Structures:**
  * Arrays
  * Linked Lists (singly, doubly)
  * Stacks
  * Queues
  * Priority Queues
  * Sets
  * Maps (Hash Tables)
* **Tree-Based Structures:**
  * Binary Search Trees (BST)
    * Traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
    * Height and balance
  * Tries
  * Heaps (min and max)
    * Visualization

### Algorithms

* **Searching and Sorting:**
  * Linear Search
  * Binary Search
  * Bubble Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Heap Sort
* **Graph Algorithms:**
  * Graph Representations
    * Adjacency List
    * Adjacency Matrix
    * Incidence Matrix
  * Graph Traversal
    * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    * Depth-First Search (DFS)
  * Shortest Path Algorithms
  * Minimum Spanning Trees
